          <h4 id="virtually"> Virtually Design Arrangements</h4>
          <p>  Access the Virtual Studio during the design consultation and "virtually" build the customer's personalized arrangements on the fly.  From the virtual studio, search the 
          Image Gallery for flower types that meet the customer's needs.  Add the flowers (and desired quantities) to the individual arrangement.  Tab through each individual
          arrangement to quickly and easily provide your customer with a visual "taste" of what the arrangements will look like.   <a href="/">Go Back</a></p><br>

          <h4 id="generate">Generate Winning Quotes & Proposals</h4>
          <p> You've got more important things to focus on.  So, let CenterpieceFMT do the math and some of the other dirty work for you.  CenterpieceFMT gathers the relevant 
          information - already captured within your product catalog, the virtual studio, and the event details - and generates recommended list prices for each of the arrangements.  
          As well, CenterpieceFMT will total the budgeted hours and stem counts for each arrangement and - in total - for the event.
          As you tweak the customer quote, CenterpieceFMT will calculate the overall profit for the event as well as the per item price for each of the arrangements.  </p><br>

           <p>Using the images, details, numbers, and information you've captured for an event, CenterpieceFMT will generate a professional-looking quote for your customers.
          The customizable quote includes a cover page, the event details, pricing and details for each arrangement, and a signature page (complete with any relevant legal 
          language for your business).  CenterpieceFMT allows you to quickly and easily make adjustments to the quote, including the ability to exclude certain arrangements 
          from the quote. <a href="/">Go Back</a></p><br>

          <h4 id="wholesale">Place Wholesale Orders</h4>
          <p> Once you've won the customer, you'll want to schedule the wholesale order date for the event.  Once again, Centerpiece will do some the dirty work for you.  
          CenterpieceFMT consolidates the stem counts for all of your upcoming events into a single concise list -itemizing exactly how many bunches of which types of
          flowers you will need to order from the wholesaler. <a href="/">Go Back</a></p><br>

           <h4 id="ddd">Design & Deliver the Event</h4>
          <p>On the design day for the event, use the Design Day Details Summary generated by CenterpieceFMT as your "grocery list" for the event.  It is the "love child" of the 
          Customer Quote and the Wholesale Order List.  The Design Day Details Summary 
          itemizes all of the things you will need for the individual event, including all flowers, vases, candles, etc.  And, it provides the stemcount detail 
          for each of your individual arrangements.  Give the Design Day Details Summary to your "helpers"
          and let them round up everything while you focus on the task at hand.... creating beautiful arrangements and making satisfied customers.

 As well, Centerpiece FMT - using the information 
          already identified in your personalized product catalog - will calculate an estimated (and adjustable) list price for each customized arrangement you create.
