          <p> Let CenterpieceFMT be your events calendar, your planner, your rolodex.   
          CenterpieceFMT organizes all of your active events on the home page.  
          As you and your team create new events, they will be added to the home page view.  View the listing of all your active events, 
          including booked opportunities, open proposals, and upcoming delivery dates.  Access it at any time using any device.  Search for or add new customers.  View your 
          entire team's events and sales activities or search for just your own.  Modify the "Events After" search filter to evaluate your availability on 
          certain days or months. Drill down into the details for the customer, event, or quote by selecting the applicable link.   <a href="/">Go Back</a></p><br>

          <p>Capture all of your relevant employee, product, event, and customer details within CenterpieceFMT.  
          During the design consultation process, within the "Arrangements & Quotable Items" module, capture the specifics and details for the event and the various arrangements.  
          Then, access the "Virtual Studio" module to "virtually" design and customize the individual arrangements using the sellable items from your product catalog. 
          <br><br>The images associated with each flower you incorporate into the arrangement will be reflected in the customer quote. As well, Centerpiece FMT - using the information 
          already identified in your personalized product catalog - will calculate an estimated (and adjustable) list price for each customized arrangement you create.

          <p> You've got more important things to focus on.  So, let CenterpieceFMT do the math and some of the other dirty work for you.  CenterpieceFMT gathers the relevant 
          information - already captured within your product catalog, the virtual studio, and the event details - and generates recommended list prices for each of the arrangements.  
          As you tweak the customer quote, CenterpieceFMT will calculate the overall profit for the event as well as the per item price for each of the arrangements.  
          As well, CenterpieceFMT will total the budgeted hours and stem counts for each arrangement and - in total - for the event. <br><br> When it comes time to place orders with the
          wholesaler, CenterpieceFMT consolidates the stem counts for your upcoming events into a single concise list, itemizing exactly how many bunches of which types of
          flowers you will need to order from the wholesaler.

          <h4 id="create">Create</h4>
          <p>Using the images, details, numbers, and information you've captured for an event, CenterpieceFMT will generate a professional-looking quote for your customers.
          The customizable quote includes a cover page, the event details, pricing and details for each arrangement, and an signature page (complete with any relevant legal 
          language for your business).  CenterpieceFMT allows you to quickly and easily make adjustments to the quote, including the ability to exclude certain arrangements 
          from the quote.<br><br>
          
          On the design day for the event, use the Design Day Details Summary generated by CenterpieceFMT as your "grocery list".  The Design Day Details Summary 
          itemizes all of the things you will need for the event, including all flowers, vases, candles, etc.  Give the Design Day Details Summary to your "helpers"
          and let them round up everything while you focus on the task at hand.... creating beautiful arrangements and making satisfied customers.
